## Coding description
The bowling challenge has been developed as required with a modern DEV workflow, using ES6, Webpack, Babel and Sass.

I implemented some DOM manipulation using vanilla JS. For bigger projects, a framework or library like React or Angular can make this task much easier.

The code is structured using Object-Oriented programming and the new ES6 classes, what helps to separate concepts and have more maintainable code. 

##Implemented bonus points
- Last frame logic
- Method that creates randomly a roll
- Multi players support


## ToDo
- Tests have not been implemented due to lack of time. However, I have prepared the code to allow a future unit test implementation. Methods are quite small and understandable, and because of the parameters interface, they will always generate the same results on the tests.
